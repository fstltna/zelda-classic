  From the authors: Zelda Classic is a tribute to (what we think is) the greatest video game of all time: Nintendoâ€™s The Legend of Zelda. It has been developed into an exact replica of the NES version that we all know and love. Beyond that, Zelda Classic allows the development of new quests that can use either the traditional graphics or enhanced graphics, as well as new enemies, items, and challenges.
